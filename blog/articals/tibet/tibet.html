    <h1>Adding Tibet Into Global War 1936</h1>

    <p>After trying to capture Tibet in a few games of Axis & Allies, and not succeeding, Tibet just seemed so far away. I decided to make Tibet worth taking.
        With the help of a friend, playable Tibet was born. We even got pieces for this fantastic addition to the game, and played with new Tibet once.
        Balancing is a tricky task, so in the first edition of new Tibet, Tibet is a bit overpowered, but the groundwork for an interesting new playable country is laid.
    </p>
    <p>
        Some of the features of new Tibet are:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Ability to make pacts with different factions</li>
        <li>Cross the Himalayas</li>
        <li>Build cavalry throughout the game</li>
        <li>Unite the world under Buddhism</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Now there is a lot more nuance in these features, so I'd recommend reading through the first draft of the Tibet info sheet linked below.
        Along with that, there is custom art of the Tibet sheets for extra pizzazz. I would recommend trying out this new Tibet since it can mix up
        the game and bring a much-needed overhaul to a mostly untouched part of the board.
