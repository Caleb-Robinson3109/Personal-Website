    <h1>Using Minecraft Language Files to Make a Anki Deck</h1>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>In the quest to learn Russian I set my Minecraft to Russian. After realizing that I did could not read what I was holding, I decided to make an Anki deck for all the Minecraft items.
        Anki is a flash card app that spaces out the cards so that you learn them optimaly. Not wanting to type out all the items in Russian and in English in a spread sheet,
        I made a program do it for me. I took the language files from Minecraft and ran it through a C++ program. It spat out the Russian words, and the English words.
        All I had to do was copy and paste that into an excel file, then export as a csv file to import into Anki.</p>
