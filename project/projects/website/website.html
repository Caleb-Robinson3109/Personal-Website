    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Origanally I had wanted a place to put the game I had made, but after getting into it the project evolved into a full portfolio website.
        The idea of hosting a server on my own hardware was very appealing to me. After playing around with Apache on my laptop I was sold.
        I decided on the LAMP framework since it fit my needs for this website, and the use of those technologies in general. 
    </p>
    <h2>Technologies Used</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>HTML/CSS</li>
        <li>Javascript</li>
        <li>Apache</li>
        <li>PHP</li>
        <li>MySQL</li>
        <li>Rasberry Pi 2B</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Results</h2>
    <p>The resuts of this project is this website! As well as my learning of the LAMP framework.</p>
