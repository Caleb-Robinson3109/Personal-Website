    <h1>Pickaxe Protection - PickHacks Hackathon</h1>
    <h3 class="name">Caleb Robinson</h3>
    <h3 class="date">April 2024</h3>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>The first Hackathon that I attended was PickHacks. In this Hackathon my group and I created Pickaxe Protection!
        This is a web app that helps students find lost items. If a pair of AirPods where lost, then someone could report it
        on the app. The person who lost the AirPods could see where they where found, and claim them. 
    </p>
    <h2>Technologies Used</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>React</li>
        <li>Typescript</li>
        <li>Java & Springboot</li>
        <li>mySQL</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Results</h2>
    <p>New Technologies were learned, this was the first time I had used React, and Pickaxe Protection was born. 
        There was a lot of trial and error, but in the end we finished, and it dosn't work half bad!
