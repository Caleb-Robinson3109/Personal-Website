    <h1>Building Kasi Kule Agriculturist in Godot</h1>
    <h3 class="name">Caleb Robinson</h3>
    <h3 class="date">January 2024</h3>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Over winter break I really wanted to do a project that would take the length of the break. Having a passion for games, I decided to make one of my own.
        I chose to use Godot because it is open source and has a lot of resources. The game I ended up making is a flower collection game.
        You can sell the flowers to buy upgrades to increase your flower selling compacity. At the current moment it is not avabile to play,
        but that should be changing soon! Godot has plugin support for C#, and a homemade language GDScript. I chose GDScript. To save the game
         there is a JSON file that keeps the data. There is still some work to be done to finish the game, but it is around 95% done.
        I called the game Kasi Kule Agriculturist, because kasi kule means flower in Toki Pona.

    <h4>Play version 0 of the game now! <a href="../../../game/games/kasi_kule_0/kasi_kule.html">GAME</a></h4>
