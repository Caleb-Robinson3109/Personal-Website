    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Over the summer I got the opportunity to intern at a company called Verus. The project that I worked on was an I/O map for a 
        gas compression and storage facility. Normally this would be boring and tedious work, but Verus wanted me to do it with style. 
        My task was to make a python program that took in their excel file that has all the data that would be needed in an I/O map and convert it 
        to a .L5X file that Studio5000 could read. This would automatically format the I/O map, and any changes that needed to be made could be done
        with the run of a program, without having to manually change things. The .L5X file type is like and XML file that can be imported to Studio5000.
    </p>
    <h2>Technologies Used</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Studio5000</li>
        <li>Python</li>
        <li>XML</li>
        <li>Excel</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Results</h2>
    <p>The summer internship was a success, and the file my python code wrote is out there in the real world, helping a gas compression and storage facility run.</p>
